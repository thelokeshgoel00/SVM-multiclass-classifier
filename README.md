# SVM-multiclass-classifier
I have built a custom muticlass classifier using support vector machine. <br>
The dataset I used can be found right here https://www.kaggle.com/eabdul/dogs-cats-horses-humans-dataset <br>
I got an accuracy of 66% which is low however I compressed images even further so that it is easy on my CPU. For better accuracy don't compress
## Requirements
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Python3
